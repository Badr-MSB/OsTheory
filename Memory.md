# Caches

Caches are small memories used to speed up data and instruction access. there are several types of them : 

- Directed mapped cache : a data has only one line of cache to be stored in.
- Associative cache: the data can be stored (or found) any where.
- N-way associative cache : there is N line of cache where the data can be stored (or found).
